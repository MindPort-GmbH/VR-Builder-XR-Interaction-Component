# VR-Builder-XR-Interaction-Component [DEPRECATED]

This is the default interaction component for the Package Manager version of VR Builder, which has been replaced by the Unity package version (2.0+). 

The new version includes the XR Interaction component by default, and it can be disabled if necessary, so this package is no longer needed.

The up-to-date repository for VR Builder can be found here: https://github.com/MindPort-GmbH/VR-Builder.
